		<p>Regex Tuesday is the day where everyone writes regex for a day! Every tuesday, I will push a new challenge to this website. They can be easy or tricky, and there is sure to be a variety of different challenges available.</p>
		<p>Thanks to GitHub for the hosting.</p>

		<h2>Current Challenge:</h2>

		<p>04/09/2012: <a href="challenge1.html">Challenge One</a>.</p>

		<h2>Previous Challenges:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>No previous challenges yet.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Future Challenges</h2>

		<p>I'll aim to post a challenge every tuesday, which I will post on Reddit / Twitter (@callumacrae) / wdR. Watching the repo on GitHub will also get you notifications.</p>
		<p>If you have any ideas for challenges or would like to contribute a challenge, send me a message or a pull request. If you send a pull request, chances are I will merge it the tuesday afterwards.</p>
